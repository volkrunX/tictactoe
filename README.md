I am currently in like two months coding, please help me find a way to center THE GUIDE with the numbers table

## INSTRUCTIONS
have python installed
dont use IDLE because colorama dosent work in it, just use command prompt or Visual Studio Basic (Is this best choice).	

If your using something else thats not visual studio basic, you might need to run this in your command prompt,
```
pip install colorama
```

If thats all done just run main.py
